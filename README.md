Ecroso Games Java 2D Engine (LibGDX Wrapper)

**NOTE: In Development! This API is worthy to change drastically at the first stages.**

This is created to help aid the development of games by [EcrosoGames](http://ecrosogames.webs.com/). It is wrapped around the [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). The type of help aided by this engine/wrapper will be support for convenience classes created (which may be wrappers as well) and to help with the naming scheme (See [EGVersion](https://github.com/EcrosoGames/EGJ2D/blob/master/src/ecrosogames/engine/EGVersion.java)).

This engine/wrapper is open to the public for them to use and aid in development as well, so if you're wanting to have an extra library on top of LibGDX, and/or you want to help aid in the development, go ahead!

Currently, any games made by EcrosoGames with this engine will NOT have the source online.

Games to be supported by EGJ2D:

* Cell Defender
* Devastation
* Curiosity
